# Session: 2026-01-15

## Phase
Clarifying

## Duration
~30 minutes

## Goals
1. Set up agent architecture for long-running tasks
2. Establish foundational documents
3. Begin clarification process

## Accomplishments

### Agent Architecture Setup
- [x] Created `AGENTS.md` with three-phase model (Clarifying → Execution → Learnings)
- [x] Created `docs/philosophy.md` with Idea Garden metaphor
- [x] Created `clarifying/questions.md` for tracking Q&A
- [x] Created `clarifying/decisions.md` for decision log
- [x] Created `progress/status.json` for machine-readable state
- [x] Created `progress/sessions/` for session logs

### Initial Decisions Captured
- D001: Use libSQL over standard SQLite (Accepted)
- D002: Fork VSCode for UI layer (Proposed)
- D003: TypeScript for Logseq-like component (Accepted)

### Understanding Gained
- User wants a "Personal Operating System" with three layers:
  1. Database (libSQL + Beekeeper Studio)
  2. Terminal/AI (opencode + VSCode fork)
  3. Knowledge UI (Logseq-like in TypeScript)
- Core principle: "Work builds on itself over time"
- Three phases: Clarifying (human) → Execution (AI) → Learnings (joint)
- "Idea Garden" metaphor for knowledge cultivation

## Blockers
- Need answers to comprehensive clarifying questions before execution can begin

## Next Steps
1. Present comprehensive clarifying questions to human
2. Record answers in `clarifying/questions.md`
3. Synthesize into specification
4. Define workstreams
5. Begin execution phase

## Notes
- User explicitly requested "as many questions as possible"
- This is intentionally a long clarification phase
- Will need to create a new repo for the actual POS build
