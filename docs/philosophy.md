# Philosophy: The Idea Garden

This document captures the core philosophy of work that builds on itself over time.

## The Fundamental Principle

> Work builds on itself over time.

This is not aspirational—it's the design constraint. Every artifact, every decision, every piece of code must be structured so that future work can build upon it.

## The Idea Garden Metaphor

Knowledge work is gardening, not construction.

### Gardening vs. Construction

| Construction | Gardening |
|--------------|-----------|
| Blueprint → Build → Done | Plant → Tend → Harvest → Replant |
| Linear, finite | Cyclical, continuous |
| Perfect plans required | Experiments and pruning |
| Failure is costly | Failure is composting |

### The Garden Requires Cultivation

- **Sunshine**: Regular attention and energy
- **Weeding**: Removing ideas that aren't bearing fruit
- **Composting**: Failed experiments become nutrients
- **Cross-pollination**: Connecting disparate ideas
- **Patience**: Some seeds take seasons to sprout

### What Happens Without Cultivation

Gardens that aren't tended become:
- Overgrown with weeds (noise drowns signal)
- Rotted (ideas decay without connection)
- Barren (nothing new can grow in depleted soil)

## The Three Places Work Happens

### 1. The Database (Structured Knowledge)
- Facts, entities, relationships
- Machine-queryable truth
- The "ground truth" of what exists

### 2. The Terminal (AI Cognition)
- Execution of defined tasks
- Transformation of inputs to outputs
- The "doing" layer

### 3. The Knowledge Graph (Human Cognition)
- Ideas, connections, insights
- Human-navigable understanding
- The "thinking" layer

## The Three Phases of Work

### Phase 1: Clarifying
**Who**: Human-led, AI-assisted
**What**: Figuring out what the best solution looks like and why
**How**: Planting seeds, testing hypotheses, connecting ideas
**Output**: Clear specification that AI can execute

The clarifying phase is fundamentally human because:
- It requires taste, judgment, and values
- It involves connecting ideas across domains
- It benefits from serendipity and intuition
- It accumulates over a lifetime

### Phase 2: Execution
**Who**: AI-led, Human-supervised
**What**: Building what was specified
**How**: Following the spec, making tactical decisions, shipping code
**Output**: Working system with tests

The execution phase is where AI excels because:
- The problem is well-defined
- Progress is measurable
- Decisions are tactical, not strategic
- Parallelization is possible

### Phase 3: Learnings
**Who**: Joint reflection
**What**: Capturing what worked and what didn't
**How**: Reviewing outcomes, updating mental models, documenting patterns
**Output**: Updated philosophy, new patterns, improved process

The learnings phase is joint because:
- Humans notice strategic implications
- AI notices patterns across many instances
- Both perspectives improve future work

## Anti-Patterns (What Not to Do)

### "Just let AI figure it out"
Without clear human direction, AI will:
- Optimize for the wrong thing
- Miss strategic context
- Produce technically correct but useless output

### "I'll clarify as we go"
This leads to:
- Thrashing and rework
- Accumulated technical debt
- Divergence from actual goals

### "We'll learn later"
This leads to:
- Repeating mistakes
- Knowledge locked in one person's head
- Inability to onboard new agents/humans

## Success Criteria

The philosophy is working when:
- Work from 6 months ago is still usable and buildable
- New ideas connect to existing knowledge
- Execution speed increases over time
- Learnings are discoverable by future sessions
